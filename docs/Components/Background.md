Backgrounds
====================

Rabbit GUI has 2 preset backgrounds available, the `DefaultBackground` and the `ColorBackground`. These draw behind all gui elements similar to how a vanilla GUI will darken the screen when it is brought up.

### Constructors

```
ColorBackground(java.awt.Color color)
DefaultBackground()
```

Unlike other GUI components the background can be set at any point by calling the `setBackground()` function
