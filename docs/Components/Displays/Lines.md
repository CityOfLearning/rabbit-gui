Lines
====================

Lines are really the simplest element in any graphical program but they can provide a lot of use for creating separation between elements among other things. Rabbit has 2 lines though one is just a convenience class which is the `HorizontalLine`

### Constructors

```
Line(int x, int y, int x2, int y2, int lineWidth, java.awt.Color color)
HorizontalLine(int x, int y, int width, int lineWidth, java.awt.Color color)
```
