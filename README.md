Graphical framework built on top of Forge Mod Loader and designed to facilitate the creation of graphical user interfaces

## Getting started
We are using [JitPack.io](http://jitpack.io) for build deployment. So you must add this repository to your build script
```
 repositories {
        maven { 
          url "https://jitpack.io" 
        }
 }
```
After that in the dependencies section add:
```
compile 'com.github.FRedEnergy:rabbit-gui:v1.3.0:shaded'
```
You also can use 10 first chars from commit hash as a version
